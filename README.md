What is the Diamond ?
It's a precious stone consisting of a clear and colourless crystalline form of pure carbon, the hardest naturally occurring substance.

Why are the diamonds so rare ?
Diamonds are one of the hardest materials found on Earth. Other than that, they hold no unique distinctions. All gem grade materials are rare, composing just a tiny fraction of the Earth. However, among gems, diamonds are actually the most common.

## **Overview**

The main goal of this project was to try to understand which factors contribute more to the diamond price.

HOW? Doing a EDA and some visualization with Tableau.

Requirements:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* SeaBorn


## **Data Sources**

The data source used for all this analysis is [this dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds)

This dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. 


## **Installation instructions**

```
conda install pandas
conda install sqlalchemy
conda install requests
conda install Matplotlib
pip instal BeaufifulSoup
